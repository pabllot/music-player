<h1>Music Player Spotify-like App</h1>

On this project I was able to:

- Manage react functional components and their reusability
- Use Redux Toolkit to manage the state of the application
- Use Tailwind and make the app responsive on all devices
- Fetch data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.
